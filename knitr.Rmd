## R Markdown
Read activitydata.csv 
steps    Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA) 
date    The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format 
interval IdentiÔ¨Åer for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken


```{r readdata}

activitydata <-  read.csv("./data/activity.csv")
activitydata$date <- as.Date(activitydata$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
